=====================================================================================================================================
This is the source code for an ongoing project to create an open source [thin film interference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_interference)
simulator based on current web standards. The intention is that this program should load in any modern browser, and also in future versions be accessible and friendly to touch
based devices. 

This code currently utilizes [jQuery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_interference), a javaScript library and pure javaScript.
